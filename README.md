INTRODUCTION

Plant species identification via plant leaves based on shape, color, and texture features using digital image processing
techniques for classifying plant species using various machine learning algorithms. This research proposes a machine learning
algorithm-based system to identify multiple plants of the same genus having different species in the form of an image using their
leaf feature. The image processing technique is regarded as the primary method for classifying different plants based on various
characteristics or specific portions or regions of the plant leaves, which will then be identified via image processing.

SYSTEM PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE
The proposed system is vision based, uses image processing techniques and inputs from a computer or laptop camera. Our system
is specific towards detecting different species of the same plant. The input frame would be captured from the digital camera and the
system is broken down into four stages, Image Acquisition, Pre-processing, Feature Extraction, and Leaf Factor calculation. Image
acquisition in image processing and machine vision is the process of obtaining an image from a source, which is typically a
hardware system like a camera, sensor, etc. Since the system cannot perform any meaningful processing without an image, it is the
first and most crucial stage in the workflow sequence. 

The second step is Image Processing. It is a kind of signal processing where
an image serves as the input, and either an image or properties or features related to that picture serves as the output. In this case, it
is the structure of leaves. Now we know that the leaves of plants and trees are of different sizes, shapes and colors like mango tree
leaves are simple leaves and neem tree leaves are compound leaves. We need to understand this even to distinguish between leaves
of different species of the same plant. Feature Extraction and Description which identifies the features of the given leaf/leaves.
Feature extraction is one of the most significant steps in image processing and thus features describing various aspects of the plant
leaf must be considered before classification. 

And at the last step, we classify the leaves according to the structure and features
identified and display the final name and the properties associated with it. To train the machine learning model, a set of leaf images
of medicinal plants was collected from the botanical garden. To improve the efficiency of the plant identification system, machine
learning techniques were used over human visual perception as it is more effective.
